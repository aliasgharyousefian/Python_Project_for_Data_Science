(`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago\n","\n","*   **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room\n","\n","*   **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line\n","\n","*   **Percent Aged 16+
